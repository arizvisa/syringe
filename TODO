debugger api
    - figure out why the following logic doesn't work:

        suspendthread(thread)
        setthreadcontext( thread, {eip=wherever, eax=whatever} )
        resumethread(thread)

        something seems to mangle our context state (%eax, and stuff other than
        %eip) before we actually execute our specified eip.


python stub
    - clean up this code in order to be remotely injectable
    - merge with injector utils code

injector utilities
    - add functions for doing heap management
    - implement dynamic symbol resolver for providing to python (maybe)
    - come up with more things that might be useful
      (like a really low-level profiler (to be less intrusive) )

lde
    - start this, heh.

python utils
    - check to see if we can use ctypes for all of this
    
    - write code for calling native code for python
        - cdecl
        - stdcall
        - fastcall
        - thiscall
        - syscall

documentation
    - rewrite this TODO so it's not so broken-thoughted. :)
    - come up with more pieces to this
